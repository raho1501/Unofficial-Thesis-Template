# Unofficial-Thesis-Template
Thesis template for master thesis in latex.
Created it since there were no official template
available at my university and only unofficial ones.
Thought I would compete with those so here is mt attempt.
Use with caution and the XeLatex-compiler.
Or just import it into overleaf, works fine* there.




*Some title may look strange...
- Manual tweaking of hspaces and vspaces are needed.
- XeLatex-Compiler neccesary for the Arial-font
- If you use Overleaf you do the change to the XeLatex-compiler by heading to
Menu->settings->compiler 
when sitting in the document.
