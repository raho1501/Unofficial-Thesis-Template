A possible list of terms,
abbreviations and variable names with brief explanations may be placed
after the table of contents, but is not required. Note that although a term
is explained in the list of terms, it should also be explained in the
chapter text where it is used the first time. 
\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{l l}
    \textbf{Abbreviation} & \textbf{Description} \\
                          &             \\
                          &             \\
                          &             \\
